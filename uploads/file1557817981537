Hello Sir
For location feature , we can use geolocation function or google map in react-native.
By using this technology,we can find location info and store it to server.
React-Native is my primary mobile development language and I have experieced with location feature in mobile development
Uploading phote,video,text and see it ,it is ordinary technology of mobile development so it doesn't matter.
My question: 
	Do you have backend?
	Do you have design?
I'd like discuss more detail about your job.
